Hi all,

Nowadays, I'm researching illegal bet organizations. How is working illegal bet platforms? 
Also, I will talk about gambling addiction and why play gambling on illegal bet platforms.
What are the advantages and disadvantages? 
Which are they using deposit-money technologies?

You will find a lot of detail about how people send money to their accounts and how is working money transfer. Also, they have a lot of new deposit methods. Furthermore, how is working third-party financial systems like Paypal, Astropay, Ucash and etc?


Deep deep down 
Gambling Addiction

Actually, you can guess easily why people play gambling. Because of effortless money and ambition. Guys, guys but why they are playing on illegal platforms? What is the difference? Because of a lot of slot games and high odds. For example, if odd is 1.50 on the legal platform, the illegal bet platform sets 1.80 odd. It's so important for players. Also, slot games... For example, you can win 5000$ a minute or you can lose 5000$. But it's different from football or basketball games. Because you don't have to wait 90 min. Also, if you start to win in slot games, then you can't play football or basketball games anymore. Because, when you win on slot games, you're losing your patience. Not just for bets. You are losing your patience maybe your entire life if you cannot quit your gambling addiction. Then, probably you will be an aggressive person. Also, do you know near miss effect?
Why are people playing more after losing? Because of the near-miss effect. I shared a link about that.
Nowadays, you can see streamers on Twitch, Youtube and etc. They are winning maybe 100-200K and you want to play that. Also, you see the most dangerous game BlackJack. Streamer impressed you and you start to play. In the beginning, you deposit 50$. It's nothing.

But two weeks later you start to deposit 500$ and you can guess after two months what happened... Right, all addicted people think they are winning. Nope. You cannot win because gambling when being your routine, you're losing. Illegal bet organizations create new slot games every day and they give you money when you play first. Then, you start to lose. Because of the algorithm of slot games. You don't have to go to Vegas because online Vegas is always available and cheap until you quit gambling.

In addition, why are people playing on illegal platforms? Because they are giving BONUS. It's a trap. When you deposit, you will earn a bonus and you start to deposit money when you start to lose. It's a loop. You can find details on TedX speeches of addicted people.



Let's begin...

Deposit methods

Illegal bet organizations improve deposit methods every day. And what is the role of third-party financial systems?

1- Crypto (Most safe method)

	Players buy BTC and send it to illegal platform wallets. Nowadays, illegal organizations working on this method because they are saying it's the safest method. 

2- Fast QR

	In my opinion, it's the most complicated method. First, you are joining your mobile bank account on THEIR system. Then, the platform adds their android device to your bank account as a secure device. So, you gave your mobile bank account information.(Password and etc) I think fraud analysts should work on this method because you can find players. 


3- Astropay, Ucash and etc.(Third-party Financial Systems)

	Actually, it looks like crypto methods. Just don't have to buy BTC. You deposit your third-party financial account, then, deposit from account to platform. But, carders use this method. They are stealing CC and buying Ucash or etc and depositing to illegal bet platforms. It's a basic money laundering method.


4- ATM 

	The player sends money from the mobile banking application to ATM and the bank sends a password to the player. Then, player gives password to illegal platform. This method is not safe. Because I saw arrested people on news. Because when you give your transfer password, someone from illegal organization goes to an ATM to take money. You can find arrested people on news. Google it.
  
  
  

Recommendation to Fraud Analysts


First of all, you have to discover deposit and withdraw money methods. For example, think about Fast QR method. When a user adds a new device to their mobile bank account and if the mobile bank account has two devices, you can detect it. Also, normal phones adding with the normal model names. (For example Samsung Note 5). Other device names will be abnormal names. (Just "Android" etc.)


Also, ATM methods. I saw on news, illegal bet organization members wait next to ATM and they are using ATM for some periods of the day. Maybe bank security can analyze ATM CCTV records to find suspicious moves.




Withdraw money methods:

Because you have to wait your turn. Also, when you win, you can't withdraw your money because you are addicted and players keep playing until being broke. Illegal platforms provide a lot of withdraw money methods. For example, transfer to IBAN. 

How can we detect it? If customer takes money from different names, different banks and different amount in a month and probably sender profiles changing every transfer, it's can be suspicious. You can analyze that two-three months. Because addicted people always deposit and withdraw money. So you can use that, why is my customer sending money to an abnormal account and receiving money at an abnormal time?





The End

When started pandemic situation, more people started to play gambling. Bet crimes earn billions a day. Because motivation is dead. People think gambling is fun and bet crimes are not important. Fraud analysts should work on that organizations. Last three years banking applications are more effective and third-party financial services improve themselves. So, illegal organizations improving new methods every single day and they are using legal systems. There is no magic. 

Be safe, away from addiction, and peace <3
